<h2>NOTE:<br> Registration for Some Demographic Categories is Now Full.<br>  Some restrictions are in place.</h2>

{% endblock %}

{% block content %}


Due to an imbalance in registration demographics, we are having
to cut off registration for some categories of people. <b>Please read this
carefully.</b></p>

<p>If you:
<ul>
<li>are not looking for speed dates with men; and</li>
<li>DO require your dates to be interested in men</li>
</ul>
then in order to register, you must also refer another new speed dater
who does NOT meet that description. This means that, for example, straight men
would need to refer a balancing companion, as would people of any gender who
require their dates to be bisexual or pansexual. The person you refer can date
separately and is not assumed to be your partner.

<p>To way oversimplify, this maintains the ratio of straight men to straight
women. Of course, not everybody is straight, and not everybody is a man or a
woman. So we have the more general (but also more complicated) category:
non-man-seeking-man-seeker-seekers. So this policy maintains the ratio of
NMSMSSers to non-NMSMSSers, which from experience we have learned is one of the
most important factors in how many people at a Poly Speed Dating event get
to spend as much of their time speed dating as they can.

<p>As you can see, we're still working on putting this into clear words. Sorry
about that.


<p>
If you want to attend, and are affected by this policy, then follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>
Find a friend who doesn't fall under the restriction.  <b>Our apologies, but friends who have already
registered do not count.</b>
</li>
<li> 
Have your friend register, and have them list you as a reference and give you
their registration ID.
</li>
<li>
Register yourself.  Cite your friend in the "remarks" field so we know who your balance is and so
don't have you date someone you already know.  Include their
registration ID.  We will then honor your registration.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
We are sorry to have to do this, but it is in the interest of
making sure everyone who has already registered gets a full complement of
dates.  Registering as a group is still okay.  And if in the end you can't
join us for this one, we still plan to have more events
in the future!
<p>
Again, sorry for the restriction.
<p>


<h3>Continue to registration....</h3>
<ul>
<p>Registration options (click on the one for you):</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><a href="../individual/{{ event_name }}">Individual</a> - you may or may not have relationships 
    at the moment, but you want to look for more of them right now</p>
  <p><a href="../group/{{ event_name }}">Group</a> - You all are an existing relationship, and are looking for someone(s) together.</p>
</blockquote>

</ul>


Note that even a gay woman friend helps a lot since such a high
proportion of our women daters are either gay or bi (usually 75%).
For that matter, a gay male friend would count too.
