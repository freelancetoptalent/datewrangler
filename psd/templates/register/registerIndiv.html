<h3>Are you a group?</h3>
<p align="left">This is the registration form for individuals.  Filling it out means you
  want to go on dates by yourself. If you want to go on dates as a member of a
  set group (say you are an existing triad that is looking for a fourth of some sort
  or another) then fill in the <b><a href="../group/{{ event.event }}">other form</a>.</b></p>

<h2>NOTE: Registration for Some Demographic Categories is Now Full.  Some restrictions are in place for some people looking for women.</h2>
<h2 align="center">Please read</h2>
<ul>

<p>Due to an imbalance in registration demographics, we are having
to limit registration for some categories of people. <b>Please read this
carefully.</b></p>

<p><b>Who is affected by this?</b></p>
If you:
<ul>
<li>are not looking for speed dates with men; and</li>
<li>DO require your dates to be interested in men</li>
</ul>
then your registration is restricted. This means that
straight men are restricted, as are people of any gender who
require their dates to be bi or pansexual women.</p>

<p><b>If that describes me, how can I attend?</b></p>
<p>In order to register, you must refer another new speed dater
who does NOT meet the above description. The person you refer can date
separately and is not assumed to be your partner. (We will rule them
out as a speed date for you, since you have already met!)</p>

<p>Here's what you should do, in more detail:
<ol>
<li>
Find a friend.  In most cases, this needs to be someone who hasn't registered
yet; if you're planning to attend with someone who's already registered,
drop us an email.
</li>
<li>
Have your friend register, and list you as a reference. They should
then give you their Registration ID.
</li>
<li>
Register yourself.  Cite your friend's registration ID in the 'remarks'
field..
</li>
</ol></p>
<p>Again, sorry for the restriction.</p>

<p><b>I don't like this very much.</b></p>

<p>See <a href="{% url "registration-note" event_name=event.event %}"
target="_blank">this note</a> for more information and a longer
apology.</p>

    You can fill in any words you want here and we'll try to match you with

both, like if you want someone to go to museums with, you'd put <b>museum</b>
in both boxes--on the left to look for museum people, and on the right
so they find you. Separate words with newlines, commas or semicolons. There are a few extra fancy things you can do; learn

  <h2>Groups:</h2>
  <blockquote>
  <p align="center">Some folks will be speed-dating as a group. This means
    you might go on a date with <em>all of them at once!</em> <br>  Unless you talk to us at registration,
      you will only match groups where you theoretically would be matchable with everyone in the group.

  <p>That being said:</p>
  <blockquote>

      {{ rform.seek_groups }} I am willing to date groups.<p>
      <!--&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{{ rform.groups_match_all }} But only if I match <em>everyone</em> in the group.<p>-->

Note: Remember that this is Poly Speed Dating--just because you say no to dating a group does not mean the individuals you do end up dating do not have pre-existing relationships.

<h2>Dates with Volunteers and Staff</h2>
  <blockquote>

In order to be as consent-based as possible, when speed-dating volunteers and staff participate in the dating, they will only be matched with those participants who explicitly give consent to be matched with such people.<p>

<h2>Friendship Dates:</h2>
  <blockquote>
<p align="center">Due to the matching process, and depending on who registers, you may have slots in your schedule with no date.  During these times you can either socialize in the social area or, if you like, have us attempt to schedule "friendship dates" with people who mutually <em>do not</em> match you.  Would you like to have a few of these dates?
