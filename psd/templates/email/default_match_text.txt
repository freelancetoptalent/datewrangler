Thank you all for coming out for Poly Speed Dating.  We hope the event went well for you and that you had a good time.  We enjoyed entering in the date sheets while folks were dancing and hanging out after the dating rounds, and are pleased to be sending you the results.

Look for the next Poly Speed Dating at OpenSF (http://open-sf.org/) in June!

Some minor notes: a few date sheets were not turned in.  This means you may get some matches later on if those parties reply to our email inquiries about their preferences.  We are prone to error---let us know if something seems very odd and we can investigate (but give some time to this process).  Also check if we cruised the people you wanted (it says who you cruised below).  The tags were small and the lighting dim, and sometimes cruises go awry in these circumstances.
