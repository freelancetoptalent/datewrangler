{% if rr.flagged %}Right now you have fewer than four potential matches.  This could be due to an error in your registration.  Please contact us.  It is quite likely that there is a misunderstanding about how our matching works and that a small change would result in many matches.  We encourage you to come regardless, but if you want a refund instead, you are welcome to one.  If you come to the event, please talk to the organizers so we can help you get the most possible (useful) dates.
{% endif %}
If you come to the event and end up with fewer than four dates, we will happily refund your money.

If you have mobility concerns, and wish to not have to switch tables between rounds, please contact us.  We can accommodate you.

Due to some peoples sensitivities to chemicals, please do not wear heavy scents at this event.
