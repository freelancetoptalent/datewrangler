<h2>NOTE: Registration for Some Demographic Categories is Now Full.  Some restrictions are in place for some people looking for women only.</h2>
<h2 align="center">Please read</h2>
<ul>

Due to an imbalance in registration demographics, we are having
to <b>cut off registration for solo men who are only looking for
women, trans women, and genderqueers</b> at this time, unless they
bring a woman-identified friend.
See <a href="{% url "registration-note" event_name=event.event %}"
target="_blank">this note</a> for more information and a longer
apology.  If you want to come, then follow these steps:

<ol>
<li>
Find a woman-identified friend.  Our apologies, but friends who have
already registered do not count.
</li>
<li>
Have your friend register, and list you as a reference. She should
then give you her Registration ID.
</li>
<li>
Register yourself.  Cite your friend in the "remarks" field so we
don't have you date someone you already know.  Include your friend's
registration ID.
</li>
<!-- <li>Potentially collect free beverage or gift at the event for having someone cite you as a reference!</li> -->
</ol>
<p>Please note that trans men are not affected by this policy at this time.</p>

<p>Again, sorry for the restriction.</p>

The following auto-loads the extra questions, if any.
form.fields.1 being true means there is a 'seek' component so the
question is really a pair.
