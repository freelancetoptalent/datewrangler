Dear {{ rr.nickname }} ({{rr.psdid}}),

We look forward to seeing you at {{ event.longname }}! Here are some reminders and
final information about the event.

The event is on {{ event.date|date:"l, F d" }} at {{ event.location }}.
Remember that you absolutely need to be there by {{event.deadlinetime|time:"f a"}};
check-in and pre-event socializing starts at {{event.starttime|time:"f a"}}.
{% if rr.flagged %}
Right now, you have fewer than four potential matches. Often
this is caused by an error in registration, or there's a small change that could
result in more matches. Please contact us so we can have a look at things! We
encourage you to come regardless, but if you want a refund instead, you're
welcome to one.

If you do attend, and you end up having fewer than four dates for whatever
reason, your evening's on us-- come see us at the end of the night for a full refund.
{% endif %}
We'll have free food and soft drinks for you as part of the event. You can also
buy beer and cocktails and many other things from the bar (with appropriate
ID).
{% if not rr.paid %}
Now, according to our records, you haven't paid! If that's
true, you have two choices: <a
href="http://boston.polyspeeddating.com/Register.html">
Pay now through Paypal (go directly to Step 2)</a> or pay the walk-in rate (${{
event.doorcost }} per person) in cash at the event. The online discount will
end 24 hours before Poly Speed Dating starts.

If, on the contrary, you actually have paid: oops! Send us an email at
{{ event.info_email|default:"info@polyspeeddating.com" }} that includes your Poly Speed Dating ID and
the details of the Paypal transaction (or however you paid), and we'll sort
things out.
{% endif %}
Next, here is an automated summary of your registration: {{ rr.geekcode }}

If anything in that summary is wrong or has changed,
log in to http://boston.polyspeeddating.com{% url "account-login" %}
with the username and password that came in your original registration email, and
you can edit your information. If you have any trouble, email us at
{{ event.info_email|default:"bostonpsd@polyspeeddating.com" }} and let us know!

{% if not rr.flagged %}Finally, we want to promise you that if you come to the event and have fewer than
four dates-- because of demographics, cancellations, cosmic rays, whatever-- then your
evening is on us; talk to us as the event ends and we'll get you a refund.{% endif %}

The key details again:

* Venue: {{event.location}}, at {{event.address}}
* Venue URL: {{event.locationURL}}
* The evening goes from {{event.starttime|time:"f"}} to {{event.stoptime|time:"f a"}}.
* Check-in starts at {{ event.starttime|time:"f a" }}  You _must_ be there by {{ event.deadlinetime|time:"f a" }}

See you soon!

- Aaron, Rosa and Luke
