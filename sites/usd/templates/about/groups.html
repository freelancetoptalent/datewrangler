All About Groups in PSD

{% block content %}



    <p>As an individual, there are two ways to date groups: "Any" or "All".  In
      the &quot;Any&quot; camp, you are saying you would date a single member of a
      group, even if the other member is not a match for you.
      &quot;All&quot; requires that you match all the members of the
      group, with one exception described later.</p>
   
    <p>Groups can also specify
      whether they want folks who match all of them, or folks who match any of them as well. 
	      In the first case, they would not be willing to date an individual unless that
      individual is a match all around.  In the second case, if any member
      of the group would want to date someone, the group would go for it. 
	  
	<!-->  <p>
      Group members can also say they are not looking <b>at all</b>.  This means they are
      along for the ride, but are not interested in dating.  This may
      happen, for example, if one partner is supporting their partner pick
      up hot gay boys.  So even if you as an individual checked &quot;all&quot; you
      might get matched with such a group since their partner, while
      present, in some sense doesn't &quot;count&quot;. -->
		
		<p> Group-group matching is a
      headache--but it makes for fun dates. </p>
	  
	  
    <h2>Example #1 -- Hot Male Action</h2>
A MF couple is looking to find a man to date the man of the group.  The woman
wants to be a friend, and participate in the those aspects of the relationship,
but is not interested in sex with any more men.  They would then fill out the
form with the woman looking for nothing, the man looking for
&quot;men,&quot; &quot;trans men,&quot; and possibly
&quot;genderqueer/other&quot;, and the &quot;Any or All&quot; button would be set to "Any."
Now this group will match any men looking for men that provided an
age range that included the male in the group.

<h2>Example #2 -- Unicorn Hunt</h2>
A MF couple is looking for someone to date both of them.  Then both
individuals of the group would fill out that they are looking for men
and/or women, and they would check off the &quot;all&quot; button at the bottom.
This means they would only match those who would be interested
in <em>both</em> members of the group, i.e. bi people.

<h2>Example #3 -- The Finding Anyone Plan</h2>
A MMF triad is looking for someone to date some number of themselves.
They would all put what they were looking for--say the first man is
looking for men and genderqueers, the second is looking for men, trans men, women,
and trans women, and the women is looking for anything.  They would check
off &quot;Any&quot; at the end, which means gay men would match, lesbians would
match, bisexuals would match... the list goes on.  They would probably
have to make clear to the folks they talked to that they weren't all
expecting to date, if they wanted their dates to indicate interest on their
forms.
