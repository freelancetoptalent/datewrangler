<h3>Are you a group?</h3>
<p align="left">This is the registration form for individuals.  Filling it out means you
  want to go on dates by yourself. If you want to go on dates as a member of a
  set group (say you are an existing triad that is looking for a fourth of some sort
  or another) then fill in the <b><a href="../group/{{ event.event }}">other form</a>.</b></p>

<h2>NOTE: Registration for Some Demographic Categories is Now Full.  Some restrictions are in place for some people looking for women.</h2>
<h2 align="center">Please read</h2>
<ul>

<p>Due to an imbalance in registration demographics, we are having
to limit registration for some categories of people. <b>Please read this
carefully.</b></p>

If you:
<ul>
<li>are not looking for speed dates with men; and</li>
<li>DO require your dates to be interested in men</li>
</ul>
then in order to register, you must also refer another new speed dater
who does NOT meet the above description. This means that, for example, straight men
would need to bring a balancing companion, as would people of any gender who
require their dates to be bisexual or pansexual. The person you refer can date
separately and is not assumed to be your partner. We will automatically break your date chance with that person.

See <a href="{% url "registration-note" event_name=event.event %}"
target="_blank">this note</a> for more information and a longer
apology.  If you want to come, then follow these steps:

<ol>
<li>
Find a friend.  Our apologies, but friends who have
already registered do not count.
</li>
<li>
Have your friend register, and list you as a reference. They should
then give you their Registration ID.
</li>
<li>
Register yourself.  Cite your friend in the "remarks" field so we
don't have you date someone you already know.  Include your friend's
registration ID.
</li>
<!-- <li>Potentially collect free beverage or gift at the event for having someone cite you as a reference!</li> -->
</ol>
<p>Again, sorry for the restriction.</p>
</ul>

<p>"Top" would indicate a dominant/doing role, "Bottom" a submissive/recieving role, checking both implies being a "Switch", and "Neither" is for those for whom this does not apply.

  <h2>Groups:</h2>
  <blockquote>
  <p align="center">Some folks will be speed-dating as a group. This means
    you might go on a date with <em>all of them at once!</em> <br>  You can elect to only date groups where you theoretically would be interested in everyone in the group, or at least one person in the group.

  <p>That being said:</p>
  <blockquote>

      {{ rform.seek_groups }} I am willing to date groups.<p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{{ rform.groups_match_all }} But only if I match <em>everyone</em> in the group.<p>

Note: Remember that this is Poly Speed Dating--just because you say no to dating a group does not mean the individuals you do end up dating do not have pre-existing relationships.

<h2>Friendship Dates:</h2>
  <blockquote>
<p align="center">Due to the matching process, and depending on who registers, you may have slots in your schedule with no date.  During these times you can either socialize in the social area or, if you like, have us attempt to schedule "friendship dates" with people who mutually <em>do not</em> match you.  Would you like to have a few of these dates?
