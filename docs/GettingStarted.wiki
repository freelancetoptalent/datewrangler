= Getting Started with the Code =

First get the code base on your computer.  Do a SVN checkout as specified under the 'Source' table of google code.

== Django Portion ==

You need to install Python and Django.  Sadly, I can't remember how this is done.  Things work with Python 2.7.

Once that is done, look at the DjangoNotes and try and run the server with the test database.  Play around a bit.




== R Portion ==

Install R and get it running.

Now try running the script to show who is registered:

{{{
R -f Rs/showStats.R
}}}

This picks up the csv files you generated with the Java code and does some demographic computation.

Once this is running, the code is up and going.   The next step is to try and run showStats.R in the interactive R word (open R, open showStats.R, and cut and paste the script into the interactive window.  

Once you have this done, you can try walking through "runMatches.R" which is a script to go through the entire process.
