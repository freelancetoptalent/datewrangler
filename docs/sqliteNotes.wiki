== Checking out the database by hand ==

The following, run on our server, will show you registered people:
{{{
sqlite3 public_html/mydb

 sqlite> select * from register_person;
}}}

Listing the tables:
{{{
sqlite> .tables
}}}


== Useful way of browsing database directly ==
    For many thing, I suggest you get a database viewer for sqlite. I use https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5817/. It lets you view the raw contents of the DB.
