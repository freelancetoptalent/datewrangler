#summary How to profile and debug our system.

= Introduction =

If you want to profile it yourself, here's what I did:

From within ipython, you can say

 run -p psdmanage.py makematrix macaw2

Since there's no ipython on the server, you can run it from the command line like this:

 python -m cProfile psdmanage.py makematrix ftoast1 | more

or if you want to save the results to analyze later, specify a filename with -o (careful of the order! it's an argument to cProfile, not to Python or to psdmanage.py).

 python -m cProfile -o myoutput psdmanage.py makematrix ftoast1

This saves things in a binary format that the pstats module can manipulate. I've never actually done that, but it's described here:
