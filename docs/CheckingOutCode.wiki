= Note on checking out the code base =

There are two main forks.  Django has the django code.   java has the java code and the R code.

Website is the website, and has no code directly relevant to registration.

lib has a jar file so java can talk to sqlite.  You need to get that working with java for the java code to work (add it to your classpath).
