OVERVIEW

The overall system has three main components: 
	* the registration system that users interact with to register for an event, 
	* all of the code to look at the registrations and configure the number of dating tables and so forth, 
	* 'matchmaker' - the code that actually does the scheduling.

The last is in the 'matchmaker' directory, but the first two are combined in the 'register' directory. 


Other directories of note:

    * 'sites' - Template overrides for different sites are stored here.  This allows customization at the template level.
    * 'tests' - Some (incomplete) unit testing of the scheduler and overall code lives here.
    * 'psd' - High level org code such as the urls.py file.  This is where settings and so forth are kept.
    * 'psd/commands' - Code for some commands that can be run from the command-line interface.  This calls code in the main part of the system.



Files in register
    * admin.py - Classes to build out the admin system
